# Insurance-Sales-Predictor-Assignment
Repository contains some exploratory data analysis of a given unknown insurance company dataset and then based on that exploration, create models using KNIME and Python . The goal was to predict if the person will purchase the insurance policy or not. 
During this project I familiarised myself with:

* Binarization

* Discretization
* Data Wrangling
* Data Preprocessing
* KNN 
* RProp 
* Decision Tree
* Ensemble Tree
* Random Forest
